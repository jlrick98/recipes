## Ingredients
| Ingredient | Amount |
--- | ---
Garlic Salt | 3/4 tsp.
Puff Pastry Dough Square | 6 oz.
Flour | 3/4 oz.
Shallot | 1.5
Shredded White Cheddar Cheese | 3 oz.
Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts | 36 oz.
Chicken Broth Concentrate | 6 tsp.
Light Cream Cheese | 3 oz.

## Recipe
1. Turn oven on to 425 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet with foil and cooking spray
2. Set cream cheese on counter to soften
3. Prep
     1. Peel and mince the shallot.
     2. Trim ends off green beans, if necessary, and halve.
     3. Remove puff pastry from refrigerator. Using the tip of a knife, draw diagonal lines on pastry, about 1/2" apart. Draw another set of diagonal lines crosswise from the first, forming a crosshatch. This is called scoring. Halve pastry diagonally and refrigerate again.
1. Place a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tsp. olive oil. Add chicken to hot pan and sear until browned on both sides, 2-3 minutes.
2. Remove from burner. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet. Rest, 1 minute.
3. Remove puff pastry from refrigerator. Wrap puff pastry around chicken, cut-side up. Tuck pastry ends under chicken. Chicken will be hot! Use caution.
4. Roast in hot oven until chicken reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees, 18-20 minutes.
5. Place a small pot over medium heat and add 2 tsp. olive oil. Add shallots to hot pot and stir occasionally until softened, 2-3 minutes.
6. Add flour and stir constantly until combined and no dry flour remains, 30-45 seconds.
7. Stir in 1/3 cup water, chicken base, softened cream cheese, and remaining garlic salt. Bring to a simmer.
8. Once simmering, stir constantly until thickened slightly, 1-2 minutes. Remove from burner.
9. PLATE! Place chicken on shallot cream
