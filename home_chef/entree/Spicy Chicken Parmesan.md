## Ingredients
| Ingredient | Amount |
---|---
Marinara Sauce | 6 fl. oz.
Canola Oil | 15 fl. oz.
Panko Breadcrumbs | 3/8 cup
Shredded Mozzarella | 6 oz.
Red Pepper Flakes | 3/4 tsp.
Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts | 36 oz.

## Recipe
1. Turn oven on to 425 degrees; repare a baking sheet with foil and cooking spray
2. In a mixing bowl, combine marinara and red pepper flakes. Set aside
3. Cover chicken with plastic wrap. You may also use a gallon bag for easier clean-up. Pound with a heavy object to an even 1/4" thickness.
4. Remove plastic wrap. Coat one side of chicken evenly with reserved panko, pressing gently to adhere.
5. Place canola oil in a medium non-stick pan over medium heat. Let heat, 5 minutes. While oil heats, line a plate with a paper towel.
6. Add chicken to hot pan, panko-side down, and cook until golden brown and chicken reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees, 4-6 minutes per side.
7. Remove to towel-lined plate and season with 1/4 tsp. salt and a pinch of pepper. Let sit, 2 minutes.
8. Transfer chicken to empty space on baking sheet. Top evenly with marinara-red pepper flakes mixture and mozzarella
